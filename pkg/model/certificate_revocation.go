// RevocationCheck configures whether vc checks one of its own certificates for revocation, and what to do about the answer.
//
// This is operational hygiene rather than a security control. An operator who
// wants to present a revoked certificate can switch it off, and a wallet
// checks independently regardless. What it buys is finding out at startup
// instead of finding out from users, because a revoked certificate means
// wallets reject us.

	// list is not evidence of revocation, and treating it as such turns a
	// Registrar outage into ours. fail is available for deployments that
	// would rather stop than proceed without an answer.
